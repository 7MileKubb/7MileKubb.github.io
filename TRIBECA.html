				<h3>TASK</h3>
				<p>Prepare Tribeca for the future of film festivals.</p>
				<h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
				<p>The film festival calendar is a crowded space, but the Tribeca Film Festival stands out because it has always stood for the revitalization of New York City and it's people. It has never been about the pretentiousness of "cinema" like other film festivals. It is the anti-film festival of film festivals, the people's film festival.</p>
				<h3>SOLUTION</h3>
				<p>Embrace the chaos of immerging technologies (such as Virtual Reality) to bring the Tribeca Film Festival to more people, living up to the title as the people's film festival.</p>

				<h2>Task</h2>
				<h3>Prepare Tribeca for the future of film festivals.</h3>
				<p>Since its creation, Tribeca has evolved to have a lot of different entities.</br>From the film festival to the disruption awards, the bevy of events and programs have</br>made it unclear exactly what Tribeca stands for. As technology and media continue to evolve,</br>Tribeca needs reposition itself in a way that will last into the future.</p>

				<img src="images/TRIBECA/Tribeca_Old.jpg" height="200px">
				<h2>Brand</h2>
				<h3>We had to look back at Tribeca's beginnings to understand what it stands for.</h3>
				<p>Tribeca was founded to revitalize New York City and its people after 9/11.</br>A group of influential New Yorkers (including Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff)</br>got together to organize the festival to bring vitality back to Tribeca neighborhood.</br>The Tribeca Film Festival has always had people at the core of its mission.</p>

				<h2>People</h2>
				<h3>But the way people are consuming media is rapidly changing.</h3>
				<p>Film viewing experiences are changing rapidly. From streaming devices,</br>to Virtual Reality, the way people create, share, and watch content will</br>look very different as we move into the future. If Tribeca wants to stay relevant,</br>it needs to show it is continuing to adapt to peoples' viewing preferences.</p>

				<h2>Opportunity</h2>
				<h3>Many film festivals have an heir of pretentiousness, but Tribeca doesn't.</h3>
				<p>When we asked people why they don't go to film festivals, majority of people said</br>they didn't feel like they were literate enough on "cinema" to be able to go.</br>However, the emerging technologies are actually increasing peoples' accessibility to high quality film.</br>So, while some festivals remain pretentious, Tribeca has the opportunity</br>to become known as the most accessible film festival.</br></p>

			<h1>STRATEGY</h1>
